## Steps
- [ ] Examine current font infrastructure and type definitions
- [ ] Analyze other font engines (TTF, OTF) for comparison
- [ ] Review PDF font embedding requirements
- [ ] Evaluate pros/cons of WOFF2→TTF conversion
- [ ] Design direct WOFF2 loading approach
- [ ] Implement refactored solution with better SRP
- [ ] Test the new implementation
