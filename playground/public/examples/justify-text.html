    This short sample demonstrates how justified paragraphs spread the remaining space
    across each line. When rendered as PDF the left and right edges are aligned,
    creating a tidy block of text similar to browsers.

    Try trimming or extending the text to watch how the spacing adjusts while keeping
    a readable rhythm. The final line stays left aligned so the paragraph retains its
    natural ending.
